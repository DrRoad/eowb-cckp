# Installation

### Installing a release

The releases are available at: https://github.com/Terradue/eowb-cckp/releases

Releases can be installed using [devtools](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/)

Start an R session and run:

```coffee
install_url("https://github.com/Terradue/eowb-cckp/releases/download/v0.1-SNAPSHOT/ReoWBcckp_0.1.0.tar.gz")
library(rOpenSearch)
```


> Note the example above installs the v0.1-SNAPSHOT release, adapt it to the current release

### Building and installing the development version

The rOpenSearch package is built using maven.

From a terminal: 

```bash
cd
git clone git@github.com:Terradue/eowb-cckp.git
cd eowb-cckp
mvn compile
```

That generates a compressed archive with the rOpenSearch package in:

```
~/eowb-cckp/target/R/src/ReoWBcckp_x.y.z.tar.gz
```
To install the package, start an R session and run:

```coffee
install.packages("~/rOpenSearch/target/R/src/ReoWBcckp_x.y.z.tar.gz", repos=NULL, type="source")
```

> Note x.y.z is the development version number.

Then load the library:

```coffee
library(ReoWBcckp)
```
